# nsciter - Nim wrapper for https://sciter.com/

Based on https://github.com/citrusn/nsciter and Nimterop. Currently only supports Linux (GTK3)
This wrapper does not support compiling Sciter with source code because I don't have access to that :)

`hello.nim` - ![Screenshot of the example](assets/pic.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

Licensing - Sciter itself is proprietary, but they provide binaries for Windows/Linux/macOS
and you can use these in any projects without any restrictions as long as you mention the Sciter copyright.
(See https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/blob/master/license.htm for the full llicense).

License of this wrapper however is MIT, because why not.
